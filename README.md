This is the build of the lib32 gstreamer plugin packages
If there is an error, I don't know how to fix it, so you can only rebuild it yourself from aur
Need to install lib32-gstreamer lib32-gst-plugins-base lib32-gst-plugins-base-libs lib32-gst-plugins-good
Then from releases, extract it and install with sudo pacman -U *
